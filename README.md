# Practical_auditing
Practical auditing using the NIST 800-171 

This project will highlight an audit and use the NIST framework to help with this. 
The NIST Frameworks follows the highlevel view of 

for the first stage of this project we will focus on left of boom or the Identify, Protect, Detect part 
we will then make our system, linux and windows VM vunerable and focus on right of boom the respond and recover phase 

We will then at the end of this project focus on Lessons Learned and create a personal playbook to responed to the issue. 

Identify 
- audit of your machines and OS systems running
    - Linux Mint OS
        - creating a user, with sudo privileges, not running from root, keys of the castle. 
        - BIOS -
        - SSH configuration
        - disabling root access using a SSH key with encyption and a passphrase
          
    - Linux Ubuntu Machine (running on linode)
    - Windows Azure SIEM
        - Windows 10 VM
        - Ubuntu VM
        - Attacker VM Ubuntu 


Protect 
   - MFA - how to do this via linux?
   - Yubikey -
   - SIEM - splunk for linux and Windows defender for Windows? A centralised place? Sential? 
   - Defence in Depth -
   - 

Detect 
  - SIEM
  - SOAR - automating the process - through ansible?
  - Wireshark, Tcpdump


Respond 
   - 


Recover
